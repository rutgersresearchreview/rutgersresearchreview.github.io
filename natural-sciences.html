                <h4 class="author">Writer: Emma Cordover</h4>
            <p>I work in the lab of Dr. Audrey Minden in the Susan L. Cullman Laboratory for Cancer Research, part of the Department of Chemical Biology at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy. One area of research that the lab focuses on is the identification of potential biomarkers to improve clinical treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC gets its name due to the fact that it is missing the hormone receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2. Among other types of breast cancer, TNBC has a poor prognosis; this is because TNBC is difficult to diagnose and treat as a result of the lack of known druggable targets.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Devan Solanko</h4>
            <p>My research is in the Department of Chemistry under the direction of Professor Charles Dismukes and Dr. Anders Laursen. The Dismukes Research Group is split into two subgroups. One group works on bioenergy research, studying the way that nature stores and converts energy, and the other group works with inorganic catalysts. Catalysts are compounds that selectively increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the process. I do my research within the catalysis subgroup, studying novel compounds that show promise as light-absorbers and can be developed for use in solar cells.</p>

            <p>My name is Jennifer Tao, and I am a senior at Rutgers University in the School of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in biomathematics, an interdisciplinary combination of mathematics and the biological sciences. Currently, I work under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Laskin at the Environmental and Occupational Health and Science Institute (EOHSI). Our work involves exploring and understanding systems that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will be presenting our research this March at the annual Society of Toxicology Meeting in San Antonio, Texas. Following graduation, I plan to apply to graduate schools and hope to continue research in the biological sciences.</p>

            <p>My name is Sruchika Sabu and I am a senior majoring in Cell Biology and Neuroscience and minoring in Psychology at Rutgers University. I have worked in the Wu Lab for over 2 years and am continuously encouraged to expand my projects and actively contribute to the lab. During my final academic year, I plan on completing a departmental honors thesis. After that, I aspire to pursue M.D./Ph.D. degrees to delve further into the field of neuroscience and neuropathology.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Lara Brindisi</h4>
            <p>Predator-prey relationships can promote the successes or failures of interacting populations. If the intensity of predation is too great, prey populations become susceptible to diminishing towards collapse. Likewise, if predation pressures are too weak, prey populations can rise above their carrying capacity until their environments and resources become degraded, potentially causing population collapse (Cain et al., 2014).</p>
