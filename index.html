                <h4 class="author">Writer: Emma Cordover</h4>
            <p>I work in the lab of Dr. Audrey Minden in the Susan L. Cullman Laboratory for Cancer Research, part of the Department of Chemical Biology at the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy. One area of research that the lab focuses on is the identification of potential biomarkers to improve clinical treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC gets its name due to the fact that it is missing the hormone receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2. Among other types of breast cancer, TNBC has a poor prognosis; this is because TNBC is difficult to diagnose and treat as a result of the lack of known druggable targets.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Brooke Schleyer</h4>
            <p>I am a Psychology major in the SAS class of 2018. Over the past few years I have conducted research with the Regulation Action and Motivated Perception Lab led by Dr. Shana Cole. One topic I have been interested in studying is how social experiences can impact peoples’ ability to effectively manage and pursue their long-term goals. As a first-generation student with ambitious academic goals, I am often reminded of the distracting social atmosphere of college life, so this topic pertains to me personally. My future aspirations are to pursue a post-baccalaureate research position and then obtain a PhD in clinical psychology. </p>

            <p>My name is Stephanie Tu and I am from Somerset, NJ. I am a member of the Class of 2019, pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. Ever since I was young, I have always been interested in space and the possibility of life on other planets. During freshman year, I started researching on the topic of inflatable habitat structures for use on the Moon, with my advisor, Dr. Haym Benaroya of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. After graduation, I plan on working in the industry for a period of time and then going back to attend graduate school.</p>

            <p>My research is in the Department of Chemistry under the direction of Professor Charles Dismukes and Dr. Anders Laursen. The Dismukes Research Group is split into two subgroups. One group works on bioenergy research, studying the way that nature stores and converts energy, and the other group works with inorganic catalysts. Catalysts are compounds that selectively increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the process. I do my research within the catalysis subgroup, studying novel compounds that show promise as light-absorbers and can be developed for use in solar cells.</p>

            <p>My name is Jennifer Tao, and I am a senior at Rutgers University in the School of Arts and Sciences. I am majoring in biomathematics, an interdisciplinary combination of mathematics and the biological sciences. Currently, I work under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Laskin at the Environmental and Occupational Health and Science Institute (EOHSI). Our work involves exploring and understanding systems that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will be presenting our research this March at the annual Society of Toxicology Meeting in San Antonio, Texas. Following graduation, I plan to apply to graduate schools and hope to continue research in the biological sciences.</p>

            <p>My name is Katie Mehr and I am a a member of the Class of 2018. I am pursuing a major in Economics and minors in Mathematics and Statistics. I am interested in learning about how people make decisions and how to improve such choices. My current advisors are Dr. Gretchen Chapman and Ph.D. student Christina Boyce-Jacino. My goal is to attend a Ph.D. program in marketing or behavioral decision research, so that I can learn more about consumer behavior and decision making.</p>

            <p>My name is Anehita Oribabor and am a member of the Class of 2017 pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering. I am from Pennsauken, NJ, and am the youngest of three sisters. In my spare time I practice yoga, painting, and playing my viola. I thrive when I am challenged to think creatively and critically. My quest for knowledge and fascination for the unknown greatly steered my collegiate pursuits. For the past several semesters, I have been conducting research on structural and material concepts for the astronomic cultivation of a settlement on the Moon. After graduating, I plan on studying robotics and design in graduate school. My advisor is Dr. Haym Benaroya in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.</p>

            <p>My name is Jaimie Swartz and I am from Edison, NJ. I am a member of the Class of 2017 and am pursuing a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Upon entering college, I decided that my ultimate dream job was to "manage the powering of a major city with 100% renewables." For the past several semesters, I have been part of a research team that is simulating precisely the energy community that I dreamed to build several years ago. I plan to continue research in graduate school on smart grids and optimal coordination of renewable energy sources. I work in the Laboratory for Energy Smart Systems, a research group led by Dr. Mohsen Jafari in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.</p>

I have worked in the Wu Lab for over 2 years and am continuously encouraged to expand my projects and actively contribute to the lab. During my final academic year, I plan on completing a departmental honors thesis. After that, I aspires to pursue M.D./Ph.D. degrees to delve further into the field of neuroscience and neuropathology.</p>

            <p>My name is Wee Siang Tay and I am a Class of 2019 international student from Singapore in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. I am majoring in Economics and currently work with Dr. Olga Jarrín. Previously, I worked in a frontline clinical setting at a hospital and I served in the military. I was injured during my days of service, but I experienced genuine warmth from nurses who took care of me when I was a warded patient. My experiences with healthcare are in both as a provider and patient. The relief and gratitude I felt from nurses fuel my impetus to select the field of nursing to do research.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: David James Estrin</h4>
            <p>Optogenetics is a current tool used across disciplines to control membrane potential in genetically altered cells in vivo and in vitro. Dr. Gero Miesnb&ouml;ck introduced transgene expression in genetically modified mouse neurons to produce Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to control membrane potential via photostimulation, a procedure he later coined "optogenetics" (Zemelman et al., 2002; Lima & Miesenb&ouml;ck, 2005; Miesenb&ouml;ck & Kevrekidis, 2005; Miesenb&ouml;ck, 2009). By genetically modifying an animal's genome, scientists are able to photo-stimulate action potentials (APs) in distinct neurons subpopulations thus controlling the neuron's function.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Hemapriya Dhanasekaran</h4>
            <p>While a sexuality education system in the United States based off a public health framing educates students on how to prevent HIV/STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies, it does not teach the power and importance of sexual agency and pleasure, especially for women. Sexual agency is defined as the "the ability to advocate for one's interests in the sexual arena" (Bay-Cheng, 2003).</p>
