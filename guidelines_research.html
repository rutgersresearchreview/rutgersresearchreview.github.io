      <h1 class="center">Guidelines for Research Articles</h1><br>
      <p>Research articles serve as a platform to discuss your research. You will be able to discuss your field of research, your particular project, and the longterm goals/effects of this project. Remember, this journal is read by a wide variety of audiences. Thus, it is important to convey your project in a manner that is neither rudimentary nor at a level that is only understandable to people who are very familiar with your field of research. You are writing for an intelligent, non-expert audience.</p>
      <ul class="left">
      <h3>About the Researcher</h3>
      <li>Introduce yourself by discussing your school within Rutgers University, your major(s)/minor(s), and your future aspirations.</li>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <li>Describe the field that you are conducting research in. For example, if your project is centered on growth and patterning in developing organisms, begin the article by introducing the field of developmental biology.</li>
      <li>Delve into the particular area of this field that you are researching and explain it. Ensure to include the name of your research advisor. For example, if your project focuses on a particular biological pathway, discuss the main parts of the pathway and the parts that are relevant to your research project.</li>
      <li>Introduce the question that you are trying to answer with your project.</li>
      <li>State the goal of your project and what you are exactly trying to find out.</li>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <li>Delve into the methods that you are and will be using to answer this question. Do not go excessively in-depth. Simply provide a brief rundown of the approaches that you have or will be utilizing.</li>
      <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
      <li>State the most significant results of your research project. Describe the implications regarding these results.</li>
      <li>Discuss the future directions of your research project.</li>
      <li>Explain to the reader why your research project is important. You can mention longterm possibilities of your future results (i.e. explain what may happen after you answer the research question at hand).</li>
      <h3>References</h3>
      <li>List your references in APA format in alphabetical order.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Please ensure that the article contains ~1,000 words. Make sure to include APA in-text parenthetical citations for any information that you have discussed in the article and include the full citation at the end of the article. Prior to submitting, please review the article, particularly the disclosed results, with your research advisor. A copy of the article will be sent to your research advisor for approval prior to publication. Submit your article to rutgersresearchreview[at]gmail[dot/com. Your article will be reviewed by a Rutgers Research Review editor who is familiar with your general field of research. The comments will be sent to you for revision. After you submit the second draft with the recommended changes to the editor, the editor will make any remaining edits and publish the article on the website.</p>
